    <h1>Cats</h1>
    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p>This is where several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#Characteristics"
            target="_blank">characteristics</a> about cats would go, if I had time to properly research. Lorem Ipsum
        just didn't seem sufficient.

    <h2>Senses</h2>
    <p>Cat's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#Senses" target="_blank">senses</a> are ridiculous compared to
        humans, which allow them to be efficient predators. They have excellent night vision, can hear more octaves than
        dogs, and have almost double the olfactory mucosa of humans (used for smell).
